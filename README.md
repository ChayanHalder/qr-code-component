## My process

I felt using HTML and CSS on their own would be sufficient.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned to use HTML and CSS together to create simple but beautifull website.

### Continued development

```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top: 25%;
}
```
